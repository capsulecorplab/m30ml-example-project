= m30ml example project =

An example project for modeling stakeholder needs, user stories, data structures, using the Mach 30 Modeling Language (https://github.com/Mach30/m30ml[m30ml]). 

The output of this project is a documentation page that can be accessed at https://capsulecorplab.github.io/m30ml-example-project/

== Installation ==

This project currently uses https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[docker] for abstracting build tools, s.a., https://github.com/DocOps/liquidoc-gem[LiquiDoc] - a build tool for the https://shopify.github.io/liquid[Liquid] template language, and https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] - a conversion engine for the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc] markup language.

== Architecture ==

Contents of the `architecture/` directory are specified in the following https://yaml.org/[YAML]-based data structures, as per the https://github.com/Mach30/m30ml[m30ml] language specification, to serve as the "single source of truth" for a project.

==== Stakeholder Need ====

*Purpose:* Capture statements of need from the perspective of system stakeholders identifying the system to be developed.  Stakeholder needs do not need to be strictly testable.  Later analysis will develop verifiable requirements from the stakeholder needs.
